Lobotomy Loadout Mod
====================

A quality of life mod for Lobotomy Corporation.

Adds buttons to the equipment management screen to load and save your
EGO loadout. Convenient for when you're using the memory repository a
lot and it's annoying to reassign all your EGO every time.

If EGO is lost in battle, or an agent cannot equip it due to their
stats, it will simply be unassigned. Also, this mod identifies agents
by name, so it will not work if you have multiple agents with the same
name.
