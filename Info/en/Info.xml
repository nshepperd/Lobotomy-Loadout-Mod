<name>Loadout Mod</name>
<descs>
<desc>Adds buttons to the equipment management screen to load</desc>
<desc>and save your EGO loadout. Convenient for when you're using</desc>
<desc>the memory repository a lot and it's annoying to reassign all</desc>
<desc>your EGO every time.</desc>
<desc>If EGO is lost in battle, or an agent cannot equip it due to their stats,</desc>
<desc>it will simply be unassigned. Also, this mod identifies agents by name, so</desc>
<desc>it will not work if you have multiple agents with the same name.</desc>
